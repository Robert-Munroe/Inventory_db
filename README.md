# Inventory_db

This code is set up for unique use with founders science. In order to use you need to use founders unique system for organizing their inventory. 

FSG_ID can only be ##[S or R]#### it is set up. (lower case S and R will default to uppercase, even if the user types lowercase)

Any field when adding an entry will be treaded as an invalid entry, be handled by the program, and provide an error pop-up that tells you what was wrong. 

You will need to change the path for the DB on your system. When I build this for an exe I change the DB location, then create the exe.
